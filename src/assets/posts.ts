        `Google AI defines a backslap as:
“A gesture that can be a hearty slap on the back to show friendliness, congratulations, or joviality. However, it can also be perceived as overly forceful or aggressive, and is generally considered inappropriate in most social settings.”
I can’t imagine a better description for a 12 hour unsupported ultra day cresting a 14k ft. peakâ€¦ twice. 
Pikes Peak imposes constantly on the skyline of Colorado Springs. It cannot be escaped. In summer it looms against the clear blue skies, attracting afternoon storms. In winter its mass hides the sun at damn near 4 o’clock. Living in the Springs means having a relationship with this mountain.
My first ascent took over 8 hours. I was 20 years old and totally unprepared. I experienced excruciating headaches after treeline and my pace was abysmally slow. With the support of a very patient friend (thank you, Brienne) I made it to the top but was in bad shape and practically collapsed. We got a ride down in the bed of a pickup and I threw up out the back. My first experience in the alpine was a backslap from the mountain to me - forceful and aggressive. In time I would come to think of the experience as a friendly welcome into a challenging new world. 
In the following years I would spend many hours on the mountain. Its lower slopes contained the Manitou Incline which would become a haven. As I challenged myself for time I made a curious discovery. Whenever my heartbeat exceeded a certain level something happened inside. Increasing the effort forwards would inevitably turn into struggle, and my thoughts would become colored in a new way - sometimes negatively tinged, sometimes filled with courage. I never knew what I would find. Pushing forwards and attempting to reach a new limit was a process of self discovery. This relationship between physical exertion and psychology would be at the center of my developing passion for endurance training. 
Fast forward about 8 years and thousands of miles, it was Summer 2022 and I selected the Pikes Peak Backslap for my second FKT attempt. At 40 miles with 12k feet of gain, the route is a little nutty: 
Summit Pikes Peak via the Pikes Peak Ascent trail
Descends via the Craags route on the other side
Tap the sign at the bottom, and immediately head back up.
Retrace your steps all the way to the beginning!
The Ascent trail differs slightly from the standard and well-known Barr Trail. The most notable difference is that it doesn't start at a trailhead at all, but rather outside downtown Manitou Springs. The other difference is that when you pass the water facility on Hydro Street, instead of turning right up the steep road into the Barr Trail parking lot you continue up the paved road. After about Â½ mile you pass through a gate to begin the trail section. This option connects with the standard trail after a couple switchbacks and then follows Barr Trail all the way to the summit. 
Starting an epic day on a non-descript sidewalk and then running through swaths of pedestrians means you get a bunch of funny stares.


“Don’t they know the trailhead is up there?” 
“They must not be from around here.”
”Hope they know to get off the peak by noon!”
Finishing is even better though, because this route ends right where it begins and you will be running through these same streets either victorious or limping, and maybe both. 
Thankfully, the day would go my way and I would be finishing less than 12 hours later with my first FKT.
The first few miles up Pikes Peak are some of the most challenging so I took my time. Even though it’s paved, the road up through Manitou Springs gets incredibly steep and can drain your legs before you even get on the trail. I had started relatively late at 6am, opting for better sleep against following the standard alpine protocol of “off the peak by noon!”. I often find these adventuring best-practices to more resemble platitudes, repeated by people who want the best and safety for others but end up contributing to a culture of fear mongering. The result of this for me has been many afternoon summits with calm weather, under perfect blue skies, without a soul in sight.
Barr Trail is a mountain runner's dream. It is evenly graded, steep but almost entirely runnable. It quickly rises from the town and then follows a more even grade before switchbacking up the face of the mountain. In the summer there are several streams that provide fillup spots so that runners don’t need to carry much. When I run the ascent for time I start with a single bottle filled with calories, then take advantage of streams around miles 5 and 9 before getting to the top where a soda fountain buffet awaits. For this effort I could only fill up with water from the public non-commercial fountain as the Unsupported rules state:
“Public taps along the trail are fine, but no water from any commercial source even if free.”
Would the water spigot on the soda fountain be disqualified as a free commercial source, whereas the non-commercial fountain by the bathroom would not? This complicates matters as the latter is marked with a “no bottles” sign, directing users to the soda fountain. At any rate, with Main Character Syndrome at a personal high, having just summitted the peak and in short supply of breath (not to mention the intent to descend the foreign side of the mountain) I filled my bottles anyways and did my best to look haggard, thirsty, and oblivious.
Descending via the Crags was immediately thrilling. The full magnitude of the day set in as I looked back at Colorado Springs disappearing from view. There were many hikers descending at this point and I enjoyed jogging down the trail. This would come back to bite me later as my quads were totally unprepared to climb back up after taking the downhill beating. I made a friend along the way and took a picture at the bottom. ~~~TIME—-
Going back up was quickly slowed by my tired legs. My pace creeped up until it was 20, then 30, then 40 minutes per mile. I had only brought Gu gels for food and at this point they were not working. For some reason I have it in my head that in these moments what I’ll want is easily digestible “calories”, when in reality what my stomach needs is real food. Typically I calculate adventure fuel at $1/ 100 calories. The idea is that a calorie is a calorie, and injecting them into your mouth via sticky chemical sugar science project has got to be the best way. Soft-bonking on my second ascent of Pikes Peak that day, I resolved next time to pack some sandwiches. Real food is bulkier but carries with it the reminder that you are a human and not a machine. 
My nutrition woes were soon solved by the hikers I had passed earlier expressing confusion at seeing me again. “You’re going back up?!” They would all exclaim. This part never gets old. The recognition helped me regain the summit and continue down again.
