My first experience in the alpine was a  backslap  from the mountain to me - forceful and aggressive. In time I  would come  to think of the experience as a friendly welcome into a  challenging new  world.  In the following years I would spend many hours  on the mountain. Its  lower slopes contained the Manitou Incline which  would become a haven.  As I challenged myself for time I made a curious  discovery. Whenever my  heartbeat exceeded a certain level something  happened inside. Increasing  the effort forwards would inevitably turn  into struggle, and my  thoughts would become colored in a new way -  sometimes negatively  tinged, sometimes filled with courage. I never  knew what I would find.  Pushing forwards and attempting to reach a new  limit was a process of  self discovery. This relationship between  physical exertion and  psychology would be at the center of my  developing passion for endurance  training.  Fast forward about 8 years  and thousands of miles, it was Summer 2022  and I selected the Pikes  Peak Backslap for my second FKT attempt. At 40  miles with 12k feet of  gain, the route is a little nutty:  Summit Pikes Peak via the Pikes Peak  Ascent trail Descends via the Craags route on the other side Tap the  sign at the bottom, and immediately head back up. Retrace your steps all  the way to the beginning! The Ascent trail differs slightly from the  standard and well-known Barr  Trail. The most notable difference is that  it doesn't start at a  trailhead at all, but rather outside downtown  Manitou Springs. The other  difference is that when you pass the water  facility on Hydro Street,  instead of turning right up the steep road  into the Barr Trail parking  lot you continue up the paved road. After  about Â½ mile you pass through  a gate to begin the trail section. This  option connects with the  standard trail after a couple switchbacks and  then follows Barr Trail  all the way to the summit.  Starting an epic  day on a non-descript sidewalk and then running through  swaths of  pedestrians means you get a bunch of funny stares.   “Don’t they know  the trailhead is up there?”  “They must not be from around here.” ”Hope  they know to get off the peak by noon!” Finishing is even better though,  because this route ends right where it  begins and you will be running  through these same streets either  victorious or limping, and maybe  both.  Thankfully, the day would go my way and I would be finishing less  than  12 hours later with my first FKT. The first few miles up Pikes  Peak are some of the most challenging so I  took my time. Even though  it’s paved, the road up through Manitou  Springs gets incredibly steep  and can drain your legs before you even  get on the trail. I had started  relatively late at 6am, opting for  better sleep against following the  standard alpine protocol of “off the  peak by noon!”. I often find these  adventuring best-practices to more  resemble platitudes, repeated by  people who want the best and safety for  others but end up contributing  to a culture of fear mongering. The  result of this for me has been many  afternoon summits with calm weather,  under perfect blue skies, without  a soul in sight. Barr Trail is a mountain runner's dream. It is evenly  graded, steep but  almost entirely runnable. It quickly rises from the  town and then  follows a more even grade before switchbacking up the  face of the  mountain. In the summer there are several streams that  provide fillup  spots so that runners don’t need to carry much. When I  run the ascent  for time I start with a single bottle filled with  calories, then take  advantage of streams around miles 5 and 9 before  getting to the top  where a soda fountain buffet awaits. For this effort  I could only fill  up with water from the public non-commercial  fountain as the Unsupported  rules state: “Public taps along the trail  are fine, but no water from any commercial  source even if free.” Would  the water spigot on the soda fountain be disqualified as a free   commercial source, whereas the non-commercial fountain by the bathroom   would not? This complicates matters as the latter is marked with a “no   bottles” sign, directing users to the soda fountain.

Descending via the  Crags was immediately thrilling. The full magnitude  of the day set in  as I looked back at Colorado Springs disappearing from  view. There were  many hikers descending at this point and I enjoyed  jogging down the  trail. This would come back to bite me later as my  quads were totally  unprepared to climb back up after taking the downhill  beating. I made a  friend along the way and took a picture at the  bottom. ~~~TIME—- Going  back up was quickly slowed by my tired legs.

My nutrition  woes were soon solved by the hikers I had passed earlier  expressing  confusion at seeing me again. “You’re going back up?!” They  would all  exclaim. This part never gets old.
